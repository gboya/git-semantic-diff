git-semantic-diff
=================

_A lightweight toolset to add syntactic and semantic features to source control for C# and VB.NET developments._

This project is aimed to provide syntactic (and eventually semantic) additionnal informations to those provided by our favorite VCS (git, svn...) on operations such as `diff`, `log` and `blame`.
Syntactic and semantic analysis (Parse Tree, AST, Symbols Table, etc...) will be provided by [Roslyn](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh500769.aspx) experimental API.
